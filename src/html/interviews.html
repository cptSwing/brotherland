                            <p>I think our neighbors watched it all like a theaters.</p>

                                We had no solidarity from our neighbors who had lived with us for twelve years. They just watched through
                                the window or from further away. They tried to see what was going on between the young people shouting
                                slogans and the police standing there with dogs. They were just spectators, there was no solidarity until we
                                flew home. We didn't get any solidarity from our neighbors from Hoyerswerda.

                                In 2019 I was again in Hoyerswerda, there I participated in a meeting with my former neighbors. They told
                                me, ‘We didn't see that!’ But I do not think it was so.

                                Besuch bekommen | David Macou

                            <p>
                                In August 1989 we realized that something was wrong, and in October there was this demonstration with GDR
                                citizens.
                            </p>
                            <br />
                            <p>
                                We were afraid and didn't go to the demonstration. In 1990 we had our first "visit" from more than a hundred
                                young people. These young people, neo-Nazis, came to our dormitory.
                            </p>
                            <br />
                            <p>
                                They broke everything, threw stones, and so on. They told us that they would come again. Then it was
                                September 1991 and the youths came again. And they broke our dormitory again.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Those were bad experiences I had there in the last two years, after living there for twelve years. 1990 and
                                1991 were very, very bad for me. Until today I don't forget those experiences, those aggressions I saw and
                                experienced.
                            </p>
                            <br />
                            [...] They were chanting: "Foreigners out. Germany for the Germans. Pack up and fly home. You are no longer
                            welcome." so that Germany would be free of foreigners. And of course, the company listened to that and told us
                            that we had to pack up and go home. And we then flew home.
                            <br />
