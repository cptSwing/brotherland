                                In August 1989 we realized that something was wrong, and in October there was this demonstration with GDR
                                citizens.
                            </p>
                            <br />
                            <p>
                                We were afraid and didn't go to the demonstration. In 1990 we had our first "visit" from more than a hundred
                                young people. These young people, neo-Nazis, came to our dormitory.
                            </p>
                            <br />
                            <p>
                                They broke everything, threw stones, and so on. They told us that they would come again. Then it was
                                September 1991 and the youths came again. And they broke our dormitory again.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Those were bad experiences I had there in the last two years, after living there for twelve years. 1990 and
                                1991 were very, very bad for me. Until today I don't forget those experiences, those aggressions I saw and
                                experienced.
                            </p>

                            [...] They were chanting: "Foreigners out. Germany for the Germans. Pack up and fly home. You are no longer
                            welcome." so that Germany would be free of foreigners. And of course, the company listened to that and told us
                            that we had to pack up and go home. And we then flew home.
